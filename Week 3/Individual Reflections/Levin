• What do I want to learn or understand better?
Well, it has been quite a lot of updates on the "programming front" as in what to master in order to code. I still havent 
got all of the technical parts to work, i.e logging into expo and getting the build to run etc. Basicly understanding all of the tools, programs, languages, databases etc. etc. that we need to understand.


• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If i trouble shoot and fix all the technical problems that i have i hope that i can help the rest of the gang with their problems. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
Not good. I guess it's partly due to self study week and that we therefore focused on learning things on our own hand. 
As we are starting up the next sprint tommorow we will have to try to applicate scrum on a team-level. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have tried to understand the context of our problem. As in mooring, scenarios and user stories. However, some of those things will hopefully clear as we have a meeting with klippans båtsmän on friday. 
Further, i have tried to understand and implement the technical parts of the work, with mixed success.
