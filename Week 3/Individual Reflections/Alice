• What do I want to learn or understand better?
So this week I have been introduced to node.js, android studio and I have done some more practice when it comes to git.
I also found out that we will use EXPO and I’m not familiar with that. So I would like to learn how to work with EXPO 
and also how all of these tools works together, because I’m a bit confused at the moment. Everything is new to me and
it is a lot to take in. 

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point, when I’m such a newbie, it feels like I can only contribute by recommending tutorials and articles that I think is good. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
Not so good, it feels like everyone in our team is trying to understand all programmes and frameworks atm. We haven’t really divided the tasks, only going for ”try to understand android studio” or ””get git to work”. Not dividing it into smaller tasks is probably the reason why it doesn’t feel like we have worked according to the scrum methodology. For next week I will try to suggest that we divide the tasks so it becomes more clear.   

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week, I have read about our area, moorning and taken some courses on Lynda (”Learning Node.js” and some of ”android studio essential training". I have started with user stories but since we are meeting with the specialists on Friday I believe we will get a lot of insights from them. For the upcoming week I really want to get comfortable with my working space and be able to work with git more comfortable. To get there I think I will need to have a full day cooperating with my team and sort things out, straighten questionmarks etc.
