Individual Reflection Rikard

•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
		I want to get a better understanding of the workspace och the technical aspects of the work. so far we've been trying to get everything to work. still without success. extremely frustrating since we can't move forward without a functioning workspace. 

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
		Tight now i'm not sure I can help someone, I feel extremely lost in the process and have no idea of where I should start breaking down the problem. I feel we need to work together both within the group and with the rest of the class to get his to work.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
		As a scrum master i've been trying to lead the sprint planning so that we have a plan for the week. however i Find it challanging as a result of the state of kaoz we're currently in.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
		Since we havn't started coding yet i havn't contributed with any code to the project.
