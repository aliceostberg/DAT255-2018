• What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have finally begun to understand, at least the basics of, how all the different workspaces are (or are supposed to be) connected.
However, i'm having problems getting the portableCDM application to work, due to the tunnel provider. I would 
to understand the reason for that to be able to fix the problem and get the application to work as it should in the emulator.

I would also like to learn more about how EXPO and Android Studio are connected, and how we are supposed to use the generated APK, EXPO, and Visual Studio code (or similar) 
to share and develop our code.  

On Friday we will have a meeting with the clients and hopefully we will get some good input for our user stories. 

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we are all beginners on the technical things, what I can do is to share my progress, if I have any, or good tutorials that I
think might be useful. Today I participated at the supervison and asked for help, tips&trix, etc, and these I will share with my team members. It 
would have been even better if the application would have worked correctly when I left class, but at least everything is built etc.


• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
This week has been short, and due to self studies our application of scrum hasn't been that good. At the supervision today, however, we 
had our first "Scrum of Scrum", where we shared our backlogs/thoughts/tips with the other teams. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have tried to get the technical parts to work, watching tutorials, reading the scenario and started to think of how to "slicing the elefant" in the
best way. I have also contacted our clients at the Mooring department and booked a meeting with them on Friday.
