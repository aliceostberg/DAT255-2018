• What do I want to learn or understand better?
Apparently the information about the tonnage doesn’t exist today, at least not in our database. Unfortunately.
We have sent mockups to the client and the mooring organisation for another feature (comment field box) and 
I am curious to receive that feedback. What I would like to learn is how to design the comment box so it looks better. 

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I could probably learn someone in our team, how to build mockups. I’m using photoshop, indesign and also keynote for animation. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have done small tasks according to scrum and our user stories, tried to build stuff in the app (not very successfull) and I
completed the mockup so that we can get user insights and receive feedback. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I have tried to code but didn’t get it to work before two others in our team completed the task before me. It was a success but 
I didn’t contribute it felt like during that task. However, I decided to help to visualize conceptually how the result could look like.
And I will probably go back to coding very soon. We need to connect the comment field with a database so that we can save all input. 
That will be focus for the upcoming sprint.
