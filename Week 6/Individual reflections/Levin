• What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand better how to create value for the client and PO. As for now, we are developing a comment box for the info view. How this view should be designed to create maximum value for all stakeholders i really what i want to know.. We have learnt that the coding part is pretty straight forward. Further, i would like to understand the connectivity of the system. How should we store information between devices (maybe on different platforms) between sessions?

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I could try to understand how the information storing in the app is made, so that we in the future can focus on the dev. part rather than the connective.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have estimated times for all the user stories. Also evaluated how long the US actually took and so on. What is clear is that the estimation gets better and better as well as our velocity. We have also tried to structure up the scrum board more. 


• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I have completed several tasks together with the team that are part of our user stories. After som struggle i finnaly got the comment box to work, wich was a great success and a team effort. For the upcoming week we will have to fully prioritise connecting the comment box to a database, as well as continuing to apply scrum in an efficient way.
