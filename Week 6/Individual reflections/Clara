• What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to understand better what the PO and clients expect so that we eventually will create value for them. We tried to 
add the tonnage to the vessel info, but unfortuately the database doesn't contain the demanded information. I would therefore 
like to understand how to make it possible to connect the data (when the data eventually is available) to the application and 
prepare the application for this future connection. 

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I'm responsible for having contact with both the client and the Product Owner i will share all information I get from
them. I sent a mockup to both of them and also asked the client if they want to cut any functions in the app. Hopefully we will
get feedback soon. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
At the supervision I spoke with one of the examinators about the use of our scrum board. We need to use it (drag n' drop) more 
frequently so that the progress is more visable. I now check the scrum board more often and make sure that we are up to date. 


• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I have, together with my team, completed a few user stories - or at least tasks that are included in a user story. I 
have aslo contacted the PO and client in the hope of getting feedback from them regardning our planned functions etc.
