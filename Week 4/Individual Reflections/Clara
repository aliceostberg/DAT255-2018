INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION W4

• What do I want to learn or understand better?

During this sprint we have finally succeeded with getting the emulator to work as it should and we have signed in 
to the application. Next step is to make sure that everyone in the group can build the program and then 
we have to learn how to collaborate when coding.


• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

We are a "busy" group, where every member cannot participate at every lecture/meeting/supervision etc,
so what I can do is to share notes and information with the missing members. 
I have also contacted my IT-colleague regarding the application. He is willing to answer to questions 
and give us some directions when we are having problems, so I will keep in touch with him during the 
project and pass the info forward to my team.


• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 

This week all of us had a meeting where we tried to connect Android to the repository. 
We also met the mooring-department. This meeting gave us a good picture of how they work, acceptance criterias, 
what information they are interested in and so on. I aslo participated at the agile-lecture and shared notes 
with the missing members. Last but not least we visited the harbor and got to see what it really looks like when 
they work. It was a learning experience and, of course, really fun. 


• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

I mentioned most of it above.
