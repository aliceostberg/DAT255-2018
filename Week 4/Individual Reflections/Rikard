Reflection Week 4

•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
		As of now we ahve finally built the application in android studio, however we realized that we've all forked the prject to our own github repositories, which means that we need to re-clone the files and get them to work again. 

		when that's done the next challange and what to understand better is to make changes in the app to implement the changes we want to make aswell as accually collaborating on the code.

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
		I'm wokring on trying to understand some basic concepts well (for example npm installations), so that i'll be able to help the rest of the group if we run into trouble. it's hard to imagine helping others when I barely understand what ae're doing.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
		We're having a hard time working with the scrum framework to perfection. i think it's mostly because we spend alot of time apart working by ourselves. we need to try to coordinate our efforts instead. hopefully this will become easier now that we have working applications.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
		I've participated in lectures, as well as meetings with our clients to understand what userstories we need to prioritize and construct.
