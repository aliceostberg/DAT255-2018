• What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn how to actually code and to changes to the app. Further i would like understand the situation of the moorers to fully be able to understand which user stories are the highest priority. 


• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now that i finally got the app running and understand the tools, i can try to help others to get theirs to work. Also i can start looking at code and try to share what i learn.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
Scrum was not really applied here. We had one goal for the week and finally managed to complete it: To get the app to work and to understand the tools we vere given. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I participated in our team session where we tried to get the app to work and it wa a succesful session! Further i participated in a meeting with the mooring organisation where we visited the harbour and got to learn more about the mooring business. 
For the upcoming week we need to get our user stories up and also try to do some small changes in the code.
