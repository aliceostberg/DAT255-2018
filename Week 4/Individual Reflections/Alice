• What do I want to learn or understand better?
So this week we managed to build the app succefully and use the emulator (!!!), we have successfully signed in to the application. 
I would like to learn and understand better how we will manage to build stuff and extend the application, at the same time
collaborate on the code. 

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we are only students from industrial engineering and management (none from the IT department) and are completely 
beginners when it comes to developing apps. I have scheduled a meeting with a friend who works with this so we can go
through the basics, tips and tricks and after that I will share that knowledge with the the team. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
We sat together and struggled together and managed to complete this weeks task, to successfully build the app in android
studio and also sign in. We also had the meeting with the mooring organisation and we have created user stories. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I was at the meeting with the mooring organisation and took notes and shared user stories with the team. We had a full 
day when we sat together and tried to manage our working space, it was successful. However we still need to practice 
on how to collaborate on the code using git. So that is one of the goal for the upcoming week. Another goal is to understand 
how we can build and test stuff in the application. To get there I will start off by having this meeting with my 
friend mentioned above, the first day in the next sprint and dig into the toolbox.
