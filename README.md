# Social Contract

**Team members:**
<br>Alice Östberg
<br>Clara Holländer
<br>Levin Ahlsell
<br>Rikard Eriksson
<br>Stina Ströby
<br>
<br>
**Desired outcome:**
<br>• Learn how to design and develope software
<br>• Learn how to manage IT projects
<br>• To develope an app/program
<br>• Weekly reflecting on pre-designed topics (which bring value to the process)
<br>
<br>
**Success criterias:**
<br>• A functioning app/program
<br>• A structured process
<br>• Great code quality
<br>• Great team spirit
<br>
<br>
**Three KPIs for monitoring our progress**
<br>• __*Percieved Success*__ We will each week check how every individual feels about this weeks success. This will be an indication wich hopefully will lead to a check in and reflect up on why and maybe how things could have been done differently. 
<br>• __*Indvidual contribution:*__ Since the team should provide equal effort we will each week check (in percent) how much each user has contributed. The metric will be time spent which we will log. This number should work as an indicator to how much more (or possibly less) you should work next week. 
<br>• __*Quality of code (use FindBugs):*__ Since quantity doesn’t equal quality we will try to estimate the actual quality. That by testing the code and check amount of bugs in comparison with amount of rows.
<br>
