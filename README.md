# Social Contract

**Team members:**
<br>Alice Östberg
<br>Clara Holländer
<br>Levin Ahlsell
<br>Rikard Eriksson
<br>Stina Ströby
<br>
<br>
**Desired outcome:**
<br>• Learn how to design and develope software
<br>• Learn how to manage IT projects
<br>• To develope an app/program
<br>• Weekly reflecting on pre-designed topics (which bring value to the process)
<br>
<br>
**Success criterias:**
<br>• A functioning app/program
<br>• A structured process
<br>• Great code quality
<br>• Great team spirit
<br>
<br>
**Three KPIs for monitoring our progress**
<br>• __*Percieved Success*__ We will each week check how every individual feels about this weeks success. This will be an indication wich hopefully will lead to a check in and reflect up on why and maybe how things could have been done differently. 
<br>• __*Indvidual contribution:*__ Since the team should provide equal effort we will each week check (in percent) how much each user has contributed. The metric will be time spent which we will log. This number should work as an indicator to how much more (or possibly less) you should work next week. 
<br>• __*Quality of code (use FindBugs):*__ Since quantity doesn’t equal quality we will try to estimate the actual quality. That by testing the code and check amount of bugs in comparison with amount of rows.
<br>
<br>
**Roles:**
<br>• SCRUM Product Owner - Clara
<br>• SCRUM Master - Rikard
<br>• SCRUM Team - The rest of the group
<br>
<br>
**Empowerment & Self organization:**
<br>The Scrum Team has to be empowered to define
<br>• What it will commit to deliver at the end of the sprint
<br>• How the expected results have to be broken down into tasks
<br>• Who will perform the task and in which order they are performed

**Platform - How do we communicate with each other?** 
<br>• Communication by Slack
<br>• All team and individual reflections will be uploaded to GitHub
<br>• Coding by Github, Github Desktop and Atom/SublimeText
<br>• SCRUM board on Trello

**Meetings:**
<br>• Weekly meeting on wednesday, end of sprint, reflecting and planning
<br>• Regulary check ins every weekday

# Reflections

**Individual:**
<br>
<br>•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
<br>•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
<br>•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
<br>•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

**Team:**
<br>
<br>• Social contract
<br>• Success criteria for the teams (what do we want to achieve with our application) 
<br>• Three KPIs we use for monitoring our progress
<br>• Roles in our team
<br>• Relation to litterature and guest lectures
<br>
<br>• The chosen scope of the application under development, including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
<br>• Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
<br>• The design of your application
<br>• The behavioral overview of your application (for example through use cases, interaction diagrams) 
<br>• The structural overview of your application(domain model)
<br>• Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
<br>• Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs
<br>
<br>• The agile practices you have used for the current sprint
<br>• The time you have spent on the course
<br>• The sprint review(either in terms of the outcome of the current week’s exercise or meeting the product owner
best practices for using new tools and technologies
