•	what do I want to learn or understand better? 
I have got a better understanding how to work with the design for our feature.
However we are not going to work with the design until it works properly so what I would like to understand better is
how Async work so that we can store information without having to build a database.¨

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I'm taking a course about Async, hopefully I will get it to work and by then I might be able to share learnings. 
However we are several people who are working on the same task not to get it to work so we'll see who will be the
teacher. 

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
We got feedback from PO this week, it was good feedback and was good for our task.
Working according to scrum has not worked properly this week due to our bachelor thesis deadline. 
Everyone has focus a lot on finishing their thesis. We will most definetly do better next week. 


•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I have tried to understand how to save information from the comment field without having to build an advanced database. 
The goal is to store the comments for specific boats and units. Not there yet. But I have started to debug while coding, 
which is a nice learning. Will continue with async next sprint and hopefully get that to work asap. The method will be 
try and error :)
