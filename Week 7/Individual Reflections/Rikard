Reflection Week 7

•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
Local storing of comments. Last week we started working on on storing comments.
We then realised that the scope of global comments might be too big so we're changeing it to storing comments locally to begin with.

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Currently working with Levin and Alice on storing comments, trying different approaches and learnign from eachother.
when i encounter a method that works, i help them understand it som they can continue to develope it.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Cutting down the stories to smaller pieces with a realistic scope. this means we have a bigger chance of delivering something

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I've been working with the comentfield developement, so far we've manage to handle user imput and save it.
  Our goal for this sprint is to get the app to fetch loally sotres lists of comments and display them in a container i nthe app.
  We'll get there by exploring different packages and methods of storing data. currently wokring with Async, a built in function in React.
