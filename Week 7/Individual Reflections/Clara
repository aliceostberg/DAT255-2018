INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION W7

•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
I recently recieved feedback from our client, but the feedback was a bit unclear so i would like them to specify what they
would like us to change/cut in the application.

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
During this sprint I haven't really learned anything, except from the feedback we got on the mockup. I will, of course, share 
the feedback with the team members.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
Due to the bachelor thesis deadline a lot of hours has been spent on that course this week. Therefore, we havent been able to
have a meeting where all team members could participate. I have, however, kept myself updated at our backlog and tried to keep
in contact with the other members at slack etc. 

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
Since I had to spend a lot of time on the bachelor thesis-course during this sprint I wouldn't say that i have achieved that 
much. I have better hopes for the next sprint though :)
