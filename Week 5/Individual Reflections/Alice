• What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week has been both successful and given a lot of learnings. We have done some mistakes that we learned from,
for example that we need a git ignore file. So after that learning we needed to clone the repo again. 
However it is much clear now how to collaborate on the code and also how to add attributes to the application.
For the next sprint I want to learn how to get information from an API/ a database in order to collect the ships tonnage. 

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By doing the map over the application was probably something that helped the team in some way to get an overview of the app.
For the upcoming week I will explore backend and with my basic knowledge I will try to learn my self and after 
that I might be able to share some insights with the team. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We organized this week’s sprint much better this week and I was responsible over one task that I completed in time.
Will continue to contribute in the organisation of the sprints. It was a successful week with better structure when 
all of us helped out to create and divide tasks. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I did a map over the application and explained how the structure looks like. I also got some insights form the meeting
with the app developer that I shared with the group. Some tips on how to receive feedback from the PO through the tool
invision.com and also ideas on how to think about user stories based on our time frame. For the upcoming sprint, the goal
is to understand how to get information from backend/an API.
