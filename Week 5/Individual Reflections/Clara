INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION W4

• What do I want to learn or understand better?
During this sprint all of us have achieved to start the application. Unfortunately we had some problems with the .gitignore 
file, so when we changed one row in the javascript and commited the change to the master bransch it seemed like we hade changed 
approximately 1500 things, due to that the buildfiles wasn't ignored. What I want to learn by now is therefore how to start 
over and how to make sure that we only see the changes that we've actually made in the javascript. 

I also want to learn more about collaborating. We have put up a "Lathund" for the changing-code-procedure, so that, hopefully, 
we won't have any merge conflics that we are unable to solve.  


• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We are all at the same basic level when it comes to app developing so I will do my best to find information about how it is 
done most effectively and to keep the contact with my IT-colleague, who can help us when we have questions. Since we are a team,
everything new I learn I will share with the other members since we all have the same goal.

We've had a few meetings during this sprint and
