Reflection Week 5

•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
	There are currently two things i want to understand better: first off, how to get the GitHub collaboration to work with our react native app. right now we're committing all build files and pushing them to git. not too great...

	Once I understand what's going wrong and we get the GitHub committing to work, its time to understand the code in the javascript and start building things!

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
	Basic concepts have proven to work last week, and i've been able to help my teammates with basic things that are git related as well as getting some minor changes in the app to work. i'm gonna stick with continue to learning the basic concepts.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
	helping out with cleaning the task board and organising it. it really felt like a big difference when having an organised backlog.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
	I've managed to add a "tonnage" row to vessel info. not a huge task, but it helps towards understanding the code we're working in. right now we're having issues with everyone committing all build files to our repo so next weeks starting focus will be getting a working repo so that we can make commits with <3000 files and track our progress.
