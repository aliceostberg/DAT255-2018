• What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week my goal was to understand how to save information in the app. This goal has now been achieved as we know how to do it in theory. But we still haven’t got that to actually work in the app. So the goal for the upcoming week is to implement this succesfully so that we can show off our improvements at the presentation. 

 • How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Last week i thought that i could go trough different packages to see what would fit our needs. It turned out that none of theese were good. The key here is that that also is good to know. Now we now that we should use actions and reducers to solve this problem. By actually implementing this in the app i can help the team, PO and our client. That is the goal for the upcoming days.

 • What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As time goes by i think that we understand that the application of scrum does not really take in the results of the sprint seen as code. What we did was to set a userstory (part of a userstory) as a goal for the week – and that was what we did. We sliced up the US in several smaller task and trough looking at time estimations decided what we should do and what we would manage to do during a sprint to create maximum value. 

. • What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The goal for the sprint was to understand how to store information in the app. This did we infact do, what we need to do now is to implement that. Our goal for the upcoming days is to fix everything for the presentation so that we can present our ideas and thoughts in a justiyfing way.
