• What do I want to learn or understand better?
The goal during the sprint was trying to understand how to store comments that we have added through the comment field. 
During the super vision it turned out that there was a "pre set way" of doing this in react-native-redux, which was a surprise
for all of us. Therefore, i would like to learn more about the action+reducer to be able to finish the comment field-user story.

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I was in contact with the client during the week, again, to get information about what parts of the application that we 
could cut. Unfortunately they didn't respond. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We have been having a bit of a problem with the application of scrum this sprint. The reason for that is probably that 
some of us have been out town, and it has also been "Kristihimmelfärd". Therefore, it has been a bit hard to cooperate. 
During the last day, though, at least three of us could meet for cooperating and planning. Everyone has been working 
on the same userstory this week, which wasnt very good.. but since that story is the only function, except small ones,that we want 
to succeed with before the presentation it will prioritised. 

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I havent succeeded with a lot during this sprint, bur at least i got some information (with the action, reducer) of how to implement 
the function. We also listened to the small lecture about the presentation and asked questions about the final report to be 
able to perform the best way possible.
