•	what do I want to learn or understand better? 
Unycky to say that weeks process has not gone super smooth. Last supervision we never managed to get help due 
to that all supervisors left before helping our group. So as mentioned last reflection I wanted to learn Async. But at
this weeks supervison we were told that asyc is not necessary. However I have learned about how Async work - maybe good for future work. 
For next week I would like to finish everything in time for presentarion on wednesday, in order to do so we still need to understand
different built in actions in the application. So what I woul like to learn is that. Also be done with this user story - 
starting to get frustrated. 

•	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
Planning on starting with the finial report/reflection - will most definetly discuss reflections that helps the entire
team to learn about the process. 

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
I have worked a lot with the code this week, approximately ~16h in three days. Working according to scrum - I don't know. I mean we 
have our tasks in trello but it is not super clear deadlines or information who is doing what. Working like scrum could 
definetly been improved. 


•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I'm still working to get the code to work. I guess I have learned much but maybe not contributed to the teams deliveries, more to my 
own learnings. I aim to contribute and I'm really trying but it is lack of previous experience and competence atm. I would be so happy
if i managed to get it to work because then it would feel like I contributed for  real. It is hard to measure sucess when it 
comes to code... For the up coming spring I will continue to try and not blame myself too much if I don't manage to get it to work. To get
there I need to be patient and have good communication with my group.
