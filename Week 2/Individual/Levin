WEEK 2
What do I want to learn or understand better? 

I want to understand how to use the Android Studio and Emulator to get "learning by doing" which i think is the best way
to learn. Furthermore i want to understand and grasp the project better. I am still struggling with syncing with gradle and
getting the builder to run without problems.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

I am trying to set up android studio and emulator and syncing this with the source code of the app. Hopefully i will gain
some insights that i can share with the rest of the group. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 

We have set up a scrum structure to be used in the future. I have tried to work towards the goals we set up for this weeks sprint.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

I have tried to learn as much as i can about the tools we are using in the course and to communicate these learnings to the rest of the group.
