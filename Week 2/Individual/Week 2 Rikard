Reflection Week 2

•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
		I also want to set up a workspace to create the best possible conditions for success with the project, Same as last week. We still havn't quite figured out how to properly set up the code for the app to be able tot work with it.

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
		By understanding the concepts I will hopefully be able to help my team moving forward towords a successfull project, Still true. 

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
		I've taken on the role of scrum master, which means helping the team to move swiftly through the scrum planning and trying to apply the scrum model best we can.

•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
		Since we havn't started coding yet i havn't contributed with any code to the project.
